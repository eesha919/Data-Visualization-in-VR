This framework aims to provide an easy and natural path to a collaborative data visualization and exploration for multi-dimensional data visualization, where interaction with the data will also be possible. Immersion provides benefits beyond the traditional desktop visualization tools as it leads to a demonstrably better perception of a data geometry, more intuitive data understanding, and a better retention of the perceived relationships in the data.

Hardware Requirements: 
 HTC Vive headset with controllers are used to visualize the data in VR mode. 
 The sensors along with the HTC Vive kit, tracks the user movements and maps it to the virtual space to enhance the user-data interaction.

Software Requirements: 
 There will be a real-time data interaction between the backend server and Unity. 
 The data clustering algorithms and computations will be done in python. 
 The 3D visualization development is being done using Unity software. 
 The framework for our application comprises of a backend server, Unity engine and the HTC Stream VR.

The whole project exceeds 1 GB of storage space; thus, you can email personally for the code reference. To find the video of the demo, please refer to the link given below:
